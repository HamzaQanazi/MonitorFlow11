// Auto-assign (CLAUDE.md §13 re-scope, deliberate — was previously on the

// set only by an admin building the service, routes/services.js) — every
// other service keeps today's fully-manual flow untouched.
//
// Fires right after a request is created, inside the same transaction as the
// INSERT (called by routes/requests.js). Ranks active employees in the
// service's own department by a weighted blend of three I10-safe outcome
// metrics (reopen rate, avg resolution time, open load — same definitions
// EmployeesPage/dashboard.js already use) and fires the workflow's
// assign-capability transition through workflowEngine's applyTransition — the
// exact same writes a human assign uses (status, task, history, audit,
// notifications), so nothing here re-implements or diverges from that path.
//
// There's no human actor to check Gate 1 (a capability) against, and Gate 2
// holds by construction: the candidate pool IS the service's own department
// (2026-09-04 — service_type.owner_id is gone, department_id is the Gate 2
// anchor directly), so it can never reach outside it. Authorization for this
